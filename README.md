# Handwritten-Digit-System
The project aims to train a machine learning model to recognize individual digits. MNIST Dataset has been use to train the model using beginner-friendly libraries like TensorFlow.

Forfurther development in this project, it will be proposed to have a GUI system, which will ensure interactive environment between the user and the developer. The GUI maybe anything from a canvas or uploading images of single digits or even scanning image from local device using the webcam.

**Due to lack of support of GUI systems and files on Google Colab they have not been developed in this project.
